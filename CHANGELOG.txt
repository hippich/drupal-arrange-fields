Changelog for Arrange Fields  
===================


6-21-2010  
 Added support for userreference and nodereference, as well as the File
 widget, and Date module's widgets.
 
 Because of a bug introduced when you can have resizable textfields inside
 of a fieldset, I disabled having resizable textfields inside of a fieldset.
 
 Fixed a bug where CAPTCHA's buttons were not showing up correctly.

 Made it so that vertical tabs works, by upping the weight of the module
 in the system table, as well as a few code changes.
 

6-20-2010
 Added preliminary support for Webform in addition to CCK.  Also, fixed a bug
 where the CSS and JS were not being re-added if the form failed validation.
 

6-13-2010
 Fixed a display bug where the wrong CSS ID was being used with fieldsets.
 Also, changed the menu hooks so they better integrate with CCK.
