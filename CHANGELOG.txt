Changelog for Arrange Fields
===================

7-07-2010
 Fixed a bug where File fields were not working for Webforms.  Wrappers were
 being added twice.


7-06-2010
 Added a much cleaner and neater method of finding valid fields in $form,
 regardless of how many levels deep they are nested.  I still can't guarantee
 that it will work on $form arrays with very complicated structures, but it
 at least lets you have 2 or more levels of nesting w/o causing a problem.  This
 is mostly for custom forms which the developer herself might have created.
 $form's from CCK and Webform have never used nesting in this way.
 
 Fixed a bug where javascript couldn't save the form correctly.  Happened
 after you make changes to a CCK field in the popup, then close the popup.  It
 was supposed to save the form, but it wasn't doing it correctly.

 Fixed a bug where, for webforms, the submit buttons were not getting a draggable
 handle with an icon.
 
 Added the "add markup" button to webform as well as generic forms, not just CCK.

7-01-2010
 You can now adjust the z-index easily with the markup elements.

 
6-30-2010
 Added the ability to add arbitrary markup to a form.  It is still in development,
 and at this time, very basic.  I hope to flesh it out quite a bit.


6-29-2010
 Fixed a CSS bug involving the date module, when a date field is placed in a
 fieldset.  Also, added some new CSS styles (and a new Configure image
 thanks to the mini set at famfamfam.com).  Also, tightened up the look
 of the config dialog.
 
 Made it so you can set width and height of fieldset wrappers, which will
 possibly correct some ugliness without needing the user to go edit
 CSS files themselves.


6-28-2010
 Fixed an annoying jQuery bug in IE, where it was causing errors to get fired off
 when trying to use the .resizable() function.
 
 Added in menu hooks and settings pages to let users edit *any* form,
 not just CCK or webform.

6-25-2010
 Added a new "conf" link when you hover over most fields.  It creates a jQuery dialog,
 which lets you change the with and height of the wrapper, as well as whether
 or not the label is inline.
 
 Also, added the menu items to let you edit any form, though this is still not
 well fleshed out.


6-21-2010
 Added support for userreference and nodereference, as well as the File
 widget, and Date module's widgets.
 
 Because of a bug introduced when you can have resizable textfields inside
 of a fieldset, I disabled having resizable textfields inside of a fieldset.
 
 Fixed a bug where CAPTCHA's buttons were not showing up correctly.

 Made it so that vertical tabs works, by upping the weight of the module
 in the system table, as well as a few code changes.
 

6-20-2010
 Added preliminary support for Webform in addition to CCK.  Also, fixed a bug
 where the CSS and JS were not being re-added if the form failed validation.
 

6-13-2010
 Fixed a display bug where the wrong CSS ID was being used with fieldsets.
 Also, changed the menu hooks so they better integrate with CCK.


6-12-2010 : Initial creation of project on drupal.org.
