Changelog for Arrange Fields
For Drupal 7.x
===================

6-30-2011
 Added support for the Mollom module, when using Webforms (it was not
 arrangeble until now)

5-26-2011
 Added a new "Enable form_id discovery mode" checkbox to the settings
 page to make it easier to find out form id's on the page.  If checked,
 administrators will see a printout at the top of every page with a list
 of what forms are on that page. You can then enter those form_id's into
 the settings page to arrange them.

4-17-2011
 Somehow the png graphic for the grid got corrupted, so
 I am replacing it.

3-19-2011
 Made minor change to prevent a notice from showing up when
 arranging a content type (the notice was coming from core's
 node.pages.inc, line 303).

3-16-2011
 Made a minor change when looking at elements in the form array
 to prevent PHP notice messages from appearing.

1-26-2011
 Made a slight change to init a variable before using it. This
 was causing a PHP Notice to appear in certain situations.

01-14-2011
  Tweaking some display issues, and doing my best to get rid
  of PHP notices being generated from this module.  Also, corrected
  some instruction text to be correct for D7, instead of D6.

01-13-2011
  Putting out the first (alpha) release for Drupal 7

01-07-2011
  Working from the 6x-1.4 version of Arrange Fields to try and create
  a port for D7.
